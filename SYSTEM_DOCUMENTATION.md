### Sample Data Processing

The system successfully processes bank statement files with the following format:

```csv
Transaction_ID,Date,Description,Amount,Balance,Account_Number
TXN001,2025-01-01,Opening Balance,1000.00,1000.00,ACC001
TXN002,2025-01-02,Salary Credit,5000.00,6000.00,ACC001
TXN003,2025-01-03,Utility Payment,-150.00,5850.00,ACC001
```

### Getting Started

#### 1. Server Access

- **Development Server**: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
- **Admin Interface**: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
- **API Root**: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/

#### 2. Admin Credentials

- **Username**: admin1
- **Password**: (set during superuser creation)

#### 3. API Testing

Use tools like curl, Postman, or the Django REST Framework browser interface:

```bash
# List all transactions
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/reconciliation/transactions/

# List companies
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/reconciliation/companies/

# Check file upload status
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/reconciliation/file-uploads/
```

### Development & Testing

#### Running Tests

```bash
# Run comprehensive system test
/Users/mdangallage/teera-assessment/venv/bin/python test_system.py

# Django management commands
/Users/mdangallage/teera-assessment/venv/bin/python manage.py check
/Users/mdangallage/teera-assessment/venv/bin/python manage.py runserver
```

#### File Upload Testing

The system includes automated test data generation and can process real bank statement files through the API or admin interface.
